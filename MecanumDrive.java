         * reading minus the offset that we read in the init() method.

         *
         * if Field Oriented Control:
         *     get gyro heading
         *     subtract initial offset from heading
         *     convert heading to radians (if necessary)
         *     new strafe = strafe * cos(heading) - drive * sin(heading)
         *     new drive  = strafe * sin(heading) + drive * cos(heading)
